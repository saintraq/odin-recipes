        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Honestly, I am going to skip this part because isn't it everyone's pet peeve when there is a whole memoir attached to the beginning of a recipe and you have to scroll down a million pages to even see the ingredients?</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 slices thick white bread</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400℉205℃ and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl mix together <b>6 tablespoons unsalted butter</b> (softened) with <b>1 teaspoon garlic powder, ¼ teaspoon kosher salt, and ½ teaspoon dried oregano</b> until evenly combined.</li>
